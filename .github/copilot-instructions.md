# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Coding Prompts Repository

## Repository Purpose

This repository contains project-neutral coding prompts organized by programming languages, scenarios, and roles. The prompts are designed to be reusable across different projects and contexts.

## File Structure

- `languages/` - Prompts for specific programming languages
- `scenarios/` - Prompts for different coding scenarios
- `roles/` - Prompts for different development roles

## Prompt Format

All prompts follow a `.prompt.md` extension format. Each file contains only the prompt text itself without titles or explanatory text.

## Handling Prompts

When suggesting or using prompts from this repository:

1. **Project Neutrality**: Ensure that all prompts remain project-neutral. Don't add project-specific details to prompt files.

2. **Functional Programming Focus**: Many prompts emphasize functional programming paradigms. Respect this focus when suggesting modifications or additions.

3. **File Extension**: Always use the `.prompt.md` extension for new prompt files.

4. **Content Structure**: Keep prompt files focused on the instructional content only, without titles, purpose statements, or usage examples.

5. **Organization**: Place new prompts in the appropriate directory based on whether they're language-specific, scenario-specific, or role-specific.

6. **Proper References**: When referring to other prompt files, use proper Markdown links with relative paths (e.g., `[TypeScript guidelines](../languages/typescript.prompt.md)`) instead of plain text filenames.

## Adding New Prompts

When suggesting new prompts:

1. Follow the established pattern in existing prompt files
2. Ensure the prompt is reusable across different projects
3. Use clear, concise language
4. Focus on specific programming paradigms or techniques when appropriate
5. Place in the correct category folder

## Modifying Existing Prompts

When suggesting modifications to existing prompts:

1. Maintain the original intent and focus of the prompt
2. Preserve the functional programming emphasis where applicable
3. Keep changes project-neutral
4. Improve clarity and conciseness
